# Naming - Assigning Names to Variables, Functions, Classes and More

- Names should be meaningful

- variables & constants (Data Containers) -> use nouns or short phrases with adjectives. like `userData`, `isValid`

- Functions/Methods -> use verbs or short phrases with adjectives like `sendData()`, `inputIsValid()`

- Classes -> Use nouns or short phrases with nouns like `User`, `RequestBody`

- Don't include redundant information in names like `userWithNameAndAge`
But the better is `user`, `newUser`, `loggedInUser`

- Avoid Slang, Unclear Abbreviations & Disinformation.
- Choose Distinctive Names
  - `analytics.getDailyReport(day)`
  - `analytics.getDataForToday()`
  - `analytics.getRawDailyData(day)`
  - `analytics.getParsedDailyData(day)`

- Be Consistent --> always be consistent throughout your entire program. like to be consistent throughout your program with naming the function that get things to `fetchUsers()` , `fetchProducts()`. Don't mix the naming like `getUsers()` then `retrieveProducts()`, then `fetchInvoices()`. Just stick with one naming.
