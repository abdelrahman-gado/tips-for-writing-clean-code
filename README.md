# Clean Code

## What is a Clean Code ?
- clean code is readable and understandable
- reduce cognitive load
- should be concise and to the point
- should avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks.
- should follow common best practices and patterns.

## Key Pain Points
- Names -> variables, functions, classes
- Structure & Comments -> code formatting,Good and Bad Comments
- Functions -> Length, Parameters
- Conditionals & Error Handling -> Deep Nesting, Missing Error Handling
- Classes & Data Structures -> Missing Distinction, Bloated Classes.

## Clean Code vs Clean Architecture
- **Clean Code**
  - How to write the code
  - focus on single problems / files
  
- **Clean Architecture**
  - Where to write which code
  - focus on the project as a whole.
